## 🔍 **CRITICAL ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED**

### **1. Marketing Expense Normalization (CRITICAL)**

**Issue:** Your analysis appears to accept the $37K (2024) marketing expense as normalized
**Problem:** This represents a 92% decline from $499K (2022) - clearly understated
**Required Adjustment:** Normalize to 14% of revenue industry standard
**Impact:** +$483K to EBITDA ($521K normalized vs $37K reported)

### **2. Interest Expense Reclassification**

**Issue:** $195K interest expense included in operating expenses
**Required:** Move below EBITDA line as financing cost
**Impact:** +$195K to EBITDA

### **3. Repairs & Maintenance Normalization**

**Issue:** 2022 spike of $164K vs $44K run-rate not normalized
**Required:** Adjust for one-time repair expenses
**Impact:** +$120K to EBITDA

---

## 💰 **CORRECTED VALUATION SYNTHESIS**

### **Revised EBITDA Calculation:**

```
Base Operating Income (2024):     $1,432K
Owner Compensation Adjustment:    +$300K (your figure)
Marketing Normalization:          -$483K (industry standard)
Interest Reclassification:        +$195K (financing cost)
Repairs Normalization:            +$120K (one-time spike)
Depreciation Add-back:            +$135K (non-cash)
────────────────────────────────────────
CORRECTED ADJUSTED EBITDA:       $1,699K
```

### **Valuation at Corrected EBITDA:**

| Multiple | Enterprise Value | Implied Equity Value\* |
| -------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| **4.5x** | $7,646K          | $5,496K                |
| **5.5x** | $9,345K          | $7,195K                |
| **6.5x** | $11,044K         | $8,894K                |

\*Assuming $2,150K net debt
