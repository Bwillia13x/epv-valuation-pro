## INVESTMENT COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATION

### Primary Recommendation: **REQUIRE IMPROVED TERMS**

#### Rationale for Terms Improvement

1. **Return Shortfall:** 10.9% IRR vs. 25% target (-15.1pp gap)
2. **MOIC Underperformance:** 1.68x vs. 3.0x target
3. **Risk-Adjusted Returns:** 9.3% insufficient for risk profile

#### Potential Term Adjustments

- **Lower Entry Valuation:** Reduce EV to $3.0M ($2.0M debt, $1.0M equity)
- **Management Rollover:** Require 20% management equity participation
- **Performance Ratchets:** IRR hurdles with additional equity upside
- **Synergy Protection:** Earnout mechanisms for roll-up execution

#### Alternative Structures

1. **Growth Capital Partnership:** Minority stake with expansion rights
2. **Management Buyout:** Partner with existing management team
3. **Strategic Buyer:** Sell to larger medispa chain or healthcare company
