## üîß TASKS COMPLETED

### A) TTM + EBITDA BRIDGE ‚úÖ
- [x] TTM window: Q3-2024, Q4-2024, Q1-2025, Q2-2025
- [x] Reported TTM EBITDA: $1,790,900 
- [x] Normalizations: +$120k owner, +$40k legal, -$48k rent
- [x] EMR $80k EXCLUDED (Q2-2024 outside TTM)
- [x] Adjusted EBITDA: $1,902,900 (~27% margin)

### B) VALUATION MATRIX ‚úÖ  
- [x] EV = Adjusted EBITDA √ó Multiple (7.0x-10.0x range)
- [x] Equity to Seller = EV - Old Net Debt ($835k)
- [x] Base case 8.5x: EV $16.17M, Equity $15.34M

### C) LBO SOURCES & USES ‚úÖ
- [x] Uses = EV only ($16.17M)
- [x] New Debt = 72.5% √ó EV = $11.73M
- [x] Sponsor Equity = 27.5% √ó EV = $4.45M
- [x] Clear distinction: Equity to Seller vs Sponsor Equity

### D) DEBT SCHEDULE + FCF ‚úÖ
- [x] 5-year annual debt schedule
- [x] Working capital changes (A/R, Inventory, A/P)
- [x] Maintenance CapEx (1.8% of revenue)
- [x] Interest at 8.5% rate (SOFR+350 proxy)
- [x] 80% cash sweep principal payments
- [x] IRR calculation: 26.2% (high-20s as required)

### E) EPV ASSUMPTIONS PANEL ‚úÖ
- [x] EBIT calculation (EBITDA - D&A)
- [x] Tax rate (25%)
- [x] Reinvestment (10% of EBIT)
- [x] WACC (12%)
- [x] Formula display: EPV = (EBIT√ó(1-T) - Reinvestment) / WACC
- [x] Conservative EPV vs. multiple comparison

## üìã VALIDATION RESULTS

### QA Playbook Tests ‚úÖ
All acceptance tests **PASSED**:

```
‚úÖ Reported_TTM = 1,790,900
‚úÖ Adjusted_TTM ‚âà 1,902,900  
‚úÖ EV@8.5√ó ‚âà 16,174,650
‚úÖ Equity to seller ‚âà 15,339,650
‚úÖ NewDebt_0 ‚âà 11,726,600

‚úÖ EPV_EV ‚âà 9,982,375
‚úÖ IRR 26.2% (within 25-40% range)
```

### Sensitivities Working ‚úÖ
- [x] Entry multiples 7.5-9.5x move EV linearly
- [x] WACC 11-13% shifts EPV materially  
- [x] WC days increases reduce IRR appropriately
