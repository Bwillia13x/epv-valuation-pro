### RECOMMENDATION RATIONALE

1. Historical 14.0% marketing spend (2022) appears unsustainable for long-term profitability
2. Current 1.0% spend is abnormally low and likely represents expense reclassification
3. Revenue growth remained positive (2.2%) despite marketing reduction
4. Diversified revenue streams (6 service lines) reduce marketing dependency vs. single-service clinics
5. Strong gross margins (70%+) indicate pricing power and customer loyalty
6. Conservative approach warranted given need for sustainable cash generation

### KEY ASSUMPTIONS

1. 2024 revenue base: $3,726,101
2. Actual 2024 marketing: $37,261 (1.0%)
3. Marketing expense reclassification likely occurred between 2022-2024
4. Service line diversification reduces marketing dependency
5. Strong gross margins indicate customer retention and pricing power
6. Conservative approach prioritizes sustainable cash generation

### FINANCIAL IMPACT SUMMARY

**Baseline (Current):**

- Revenue: $3,726,101
- Marketing: $37,261 (1.0%)
- Reported EBITDA: $1,567,785

**Normalized (Conservative Target):**

- Revenue: $3,726,101
- Marketing: $260,827 (7.0%)
- Normalized EBITDA: $1,344,219
- EBITDA Margin: 36.1%

**Net Adjustment:** $223,566 reduction to EBITDA

### CONCLUSION

The analysis recommends normalizing marketing spend to 7.0% of revenue, representing a conservative but sustainable approach that balances growth investment with profitability requirements. This normalization reduces EBITDA by $223,566 but provides a more realistic baseline for valuation purposes.
