# ANALYST B TECHNICAL VALIDATION SUMMARY

## QUICK REFERENCE - KEY FINDINGS

### ✅ VERIFIED STRENGTHS

1. **Mathematical Foundation:** Core EPV = Earnings ÷ WACC formula implemented correctly
2. **Risk Management:** Conservative approach with appropriate small practice safeguards
3. **Industry Calibration:** EBITDA multiples (3.5x-9.0x) align with medical aesthetics transactions
4. **Edge Case Handling:** Robust protection against division by zero and boundary conditions
5. **Monte Carlo Accuracy:** Distribution functions perform within statistical tolerances (<1% error)

### ⚠️ AREAS REQUIRING ATTENTION

1. **Calculation Chain Consistency:** Some method variance >15% between EPV/DCF/Multiple approaches
2. **Floating-Point Precision:** Minor precision loss detected in large number multiplication
3. **Negative Earnings Handling:** Limited alternative valuation methods for distressed scenarios
