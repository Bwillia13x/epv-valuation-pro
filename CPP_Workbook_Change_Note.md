## What to Say on the Call

### üí° **Key Message**
*"We've built a comprehensive, auditable model that addresses the critical interest treatment issue and provides two-view analysis for maximum transparency."*

### üìà **Primary Talking Points**

**1. EBITDA Correction (Most Important)**
- "The corrected EBITDA is $1.08M, not $598K"
- "Interest should be below the line, not in operating expenses"
- "This changes our EV/EBITDA from 10.0x to 5.5x - much more reasonable"

**2. Marketing Reality Check**
- "Current 1% marketing spend is unsustainable"
- "Industry standard is 10-15% for growth"
- "We've normalized to 14% ($521K vs $37K reported)"

**3. Service Mix Insights**
- "Growth drivers: Wellness (+17%), Weight Loss (+13%), Surgery (+7%)"
- "Declining: Injectables (-11%), Energy Devices (-9%)"
- "Strategy should focus on expanding wellness/weight loss capacity"

**4. Valuation Framework**
- "At 5.5x EBITDA, we're in reasonable market range (4.5x-6.5x)"
- "Enterprise value ~$6.0M supports our investment thesis"
- "Equity value ~$3.8M after debt paydown"

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Callouts**
- "Low marketing spend not sustainable long-term"
- "Energy device equipment may need refresh/upgrade"
- "Injectable market showing saturation - need differentiation"

### ‚úÖ **Next Steps Recommended**
1. **QoE priorities:** Interest reclass verification, owner comp analysis
2. **Day-1 integration:** Staff retention, marketing normalization
3. **Growth focus:** Expand wellness/weight loss services
