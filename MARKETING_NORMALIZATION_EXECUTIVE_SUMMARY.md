## üîç KEY ANALYSIS FINDINGS

### Historical Marketing Anomaly
- **2022:** $499,291 (14.0% of revenue) - Unsustainably high
- **2023:** $253,433 (7.0% of revenue) - Normalized level
- **2024:** $37,261 (1.0% of revenue) - Abnormally low

**Critical Insight:** Marketing expense likely underwent reclassification rather than genuine reduction, as revenue growth remained positive (2.9%) despite 93% marketing decrease.

### Industry Benchmark Analysis

|--------------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Small Aesthetic Clinics** | 12.0% | $1,157,914 | High growth investment |

2. **Customer Retention Strength:** 70%+ gross margins indicate strong pricing power and loyalty
3. **Market Maturity:** Established practice with proven revenue stability
4. **Growth Sustainability:** Revenue growth maintained despite marketing reduction suggests efficient customer acquisition
