## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This analysis provides a comprehensive walk from reported EBITDA to normalized EBITDA using overlay adjustments that preserve the base historical dataset while identifying normalization opportunities for valuation purposes.

**Key Finding:** Normalized 2024 EBITDA of $2.22M represents a **+41.6% adjustment** from reported EBITDA of $1.57M, primarily driven by marketing expense normalization and interest reclassification.

## DETAILED COMPONENT ANALYSIS

### 1. Marketing Normalization (+$335K in 2024)
**Confidence Level: HIGH**

| Year | Reported Marketing | % of Revenue | Normalized (10%) | Adjustment |
|------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|------------|
| 2022 | $499,291 | 14.0% | $356,637 | -$142,655 |
| 2023 | $253,433 | 7.0% | $362,047 | +$108,614 |
| 2024 | $37,261 | 1.0% | $372,610 | +$335,349 |

**Analysis:**
- Marketing expense dropped 93% from 2022 to 2024 ($499K → $37K)
- Likely represents reclassification rather than true operational efficiency
- Industry benchmark: 8-12% of revenue for medispa marketing
- Conservative normalization at 10% of revenue provides realistic baseline

### 2. Interest Reclassification (+$195K in 2024)
**Confidence Level: HIGH**

| Year | Interest in OpEx | Adjustment Rationale |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| 2022 | $220,144 | Add back: Financing cost, not operating |
| 2023 | $212,167 | Add back: Financing cost, not operating |
| 2024 | $194,812 | Add back: Financing cost, not operating |

**Analysis:**
- Interest expense currently treated as operating expense (unusual)
- Standard accounting: Interest is financing cost, belongs below operating income
- Adjustment improves comparability with industry peers
- Full add-back appropriate for EBITDA normalization

### 3. Owner Compensation Normalization (+$100K in 2024)
**Confidence Level: MEDIUM**

| Year | Total Payroll | Est. Excess Owner Comp | Market Rate Assumption |
|------|---------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| 2022 | $1,217,000 | $200,000 | $400K market rate for owner/physician |
| 2023 | $1,112,000 | $150,000 | Declining excess with payroll cuts |
| 2024 | $967,000 | $100,000 | Conservative estimate |

**Analysis:**
- Total payroll decreased 21% over period ($1.22M → $967K)
- Excess owner compensation estimated conservatively
- Market rate for medispa owner/physician: $300-500K range
- Adjustment accounts for above-market compensation

### 4. Repairs & Maintenance Normalization (+$39K in 2024)
**Confidence Level: MEDIUM**

| Year | Reported R&M | 3-Year Average | Adjustment |
|------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| 2022 | $164,053 | $84,071 | -$79,982 |
| 2023 | $43,446 | $84,071 | +$40,625 |
| 2024 | $44,713 | $84,071 | +$39,357 |

**Analysis:**
- R&M shows significant volatility (high in 2022, low in 2023-24)
- Smoothing to 3-year average provides better run-rate view
- Accounts for lumpy maintenance and equipment investments

### 5. Equipment Rental Treatment (-$18K in 2024)
**Confidence Level: LOW**

| Year | Equipment Rental | Treatment |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| 2022 | $17,624 | Historical cost |
| 2023 | $0 | Discontinued |
| 2024 | $0 | Discontinued |

**Analysis:**
- Equipment rental ceased in 2023 (operational efficiency?)
- Conservative adjustment: Add back as if continued (cost normalization)
- Low confidence: May represent genuine operational improvement

## RISK ASSESSMENT & VALIDATION

### High Confidence Adjustments
1. **Marketing Normalization:** Clear reclassification pattern
2. **Interest Reclassification:** Standard accounting treatment correction

### Medium Confidence Adjustments
1. **Owner Compensation:** Estimated based on market benchmarks
2. **R&M Normalization:** Smoothing approach may not capture true economics

### Low Confidence Adjustments
1. **Equipment Rental:** Unclear if genuine savings or normalization needed

---

## VALUATION IMPLICATIONS

### For DCF Analysis
- **Base Case EBITDA:** $2.22M (normalized 2024)
- **Growth Assumptions:** Should reflect normalized marketing levels
- **EBITDA Margins:** ~59.5% on normalized basis (vs. 42.1% reported)

### For Multiple-Based Valuation
- **Comparable Analysis:** Use normalized EBITDA for peer comparison
- **Multiple Range:** Medispa industry typically 4-8x EBITDA
- **Quality Premium:** High service line diversification supports premium

### For LBO Analysis
- **Debt Capacity:** Based on normalized EBITDA run-rate
- **Interest Coverage:** Improved with reclassification
- **Cash Flow Stability:** Normalization reduces apparent volatility

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Investment Committee
1. **Primary Metric:** Use $2.22M normalized 2024 EBITDA as baseline
2. **Margin Analysis:** Focus on 59.5% normalized EBITDA margin sustainability
3. **Due Diligence:** Validate marketing reclassification with management
4. **Sensitivity Analysis:** Test impact of marketing level assumptions

### For Valuation Models
1. **Marketing Spend:** Model 8-12% of revenue going forward
2. **Interest Treatment:** Maintain below-the-line classification
3. **Owner Transition:** Consider management transition costs
4. **Growth Trajectory:** Assess sustainability of efficiency gains
