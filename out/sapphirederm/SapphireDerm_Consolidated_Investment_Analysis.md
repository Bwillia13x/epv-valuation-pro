## üìã Investment Decision Framework

### üõë **RECOMMENDATION: DEFER**

**Primary Decision Drivers:**

1. **Valuation Discipline Violation**
   - Market multiples 50-100% above EPV intrinsic value
   - No acceptable pricing within disciplined framework
   - Strategic premium insufficient to justify premium

2. **LBO Structural Impossibility**
   - Zero feasible deal structures identified
   - DSCR constraints eliminate all traditional LBO approaches
   - Maximum sustainable leverage (1.75x) far below market pricing requirements

3. **Mathematical Precision**
   - Strict EPV (g=0) methodology applied
   - Conservative cash flow assumptions validated
   - All assertion tests passed with zero tolerance

### Alternative Paths Forward

**If Investment Committee Desires Reconsideration:**

1. **Price Renegotiation**
   - Target: ‚â§7.0x EBITDA multiple ($15.5M enterprise value)
   - Required: 20-30% reduction from current market expectations
   - Equity value ceiling: ~$12.6M (EPV discipline threshold)

2. **All-Equity Structure**
   - Eliminate debt service constraints
   - Purchase at or below EPV range ($9.1M - $13.8M)
   - Focus on operational improvements and organic growth

3. **Seller Financing Alternative**
   - Negotiate seller note or earnout structure
   - Defer portion of purchase price
   - Reduce upfront cash requirements

4. **Strategic Synergy Identification**
   - Quantify specific operational improvements
   - Multi-site rollout strategies
   - Technology or process enhancements

## üìÑ Appendix: Technical Methodology

### EPV Calculation Framework
```
Owner Earnings = NOPAT + D&A - Maintenance CapEx
NOPAT = EBIT √ó (1 - Tax Rate)
Enterprise Value = Owner Earnings √∑ WACC
Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
```

### DSCR Calculation Framework
```
Cash Available = EBITDA - Cash Taxes - Maintenance CapEx
Annual Debt Service = Principal + Interest (level annuity)
Cash DSCR = Cash Available √∑ Annual Debt Service
```

### Price Discipline Framework
```
EPV Base Case Equity = $11,194,168
Strategic Premium = 12.5%
Maximum Disciplined Price = EPV Base √ó (1 + Strategic Premium)
```
